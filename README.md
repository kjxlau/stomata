# Stomata Detection
A dataset comprising of 1,000 microscopy images was gathered from the abaxial surfaces of barley and rice leaves. Barley leaf images were captured at 200x magnification, while rice leaf images were taken at 400x. Stomata within these images were manually annotated using the LabelMe polygon tool, and the resulting JSON annotations were transformed into binary mask formats. These annotated images and corresponding masks served as training data for the YOLOv12 and RF-DETR object detection model. Dataset was split into 80% training and 20% for test validation. 

## 1. Manual Annotation of Images with LabelMe
Download and install app from https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme
<br> Using the polygon tool, draw polygon objects encircling the stomata (object of interest) and label it with a class name "stomata". </br>
A JSON annotation file will be created for the class object which contains coordinates information of the polygon objects in 2D space in the corresponding image when you hit the 'save' button.

## 2. JSON to Binary Mask script
Run python [json_to_binary_mask.py](https://github.com/kjxlau/stomata/blob/main/json_to_binary_mask.py) 
<br> To convert JSON coordinate index files into binary mask in PNG format </br>

## 3. Convert segmented binary mask into YOLO format and initiate YOLOv12 model training
Run python [train_yolo_model.py](https://github.com/kjxlau/stomata/blob/main/train_yolo_model.py)
<br> Specify the number of epochs for training and augmentation techniques to use. </br>
We can try 300 epochs for this stomata project.
Augmentation includes scaling, flipping left-right, flipping up-down and rotating at various angles for training.

Arrange your image and annotation files as follows:
```
/path/to/your/dataset/
├── data.yaml
├── images
│   ├── train
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   ├── image2.png
│   │   └── ...
│   └── val
│       ├── image3.jpg
│       ├── image4.png
│       └── ...
└── labels
    ├── train
    │   ├── image1.txt
    │   ├── image2.txt
    │   └── ...
    └── val

YOLOv12 integrates Flash Attention to significantly reduce computation time during training and inference. This optimization is especially effective on modern GPU architectures, including Turing: NVIDIA T4, Quadro RTX series, Ampere: RTX 30 series, A30, A40, A100, Ada Lovelace: RTX 40 series, Hopper: H100, H200. While GPU acceleration is highly recommended for optimal performance, YOLOv12 remains compatible with CPU-based training. However, users should expect longer runtimes when operating without GPU support.

## 5. Convert YOLO annotations to COCO format
Run python [yolo_to_coco.py](https://github.com/kjxlau/stomata/blob/main/yolo_to_coco.py) 
<br>/path/to/images/train /path/to/labels/train /path/to/data.yaml /path/to/output/_annotations.coco.json </br>
## 6. Train RF-DETR model to compare performance against YOLOv12
Run python [train_RF_DETR.py](https://github.com/kjxlau/stomata/blob/main/train_RF_DETR.py) to train model for 20 epochs, batch size of 4. 
<br>Arrange your files such that the _annotations.coco.json is in the same folder as your images to train. </br>
```
/path/to/your/dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── _annotations.coco.json
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── valid/
│   ├── _annotations.coco.json
│   ├── image3.jpg
│   ├── image4.jpg
│   └── ...
└── test/
    ├── _annotations.coco.json
    ├── image5.jpg
