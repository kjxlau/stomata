### Stomata Detection
A dataset comprising 1,000 microscopy images was gathered from the abaxial surfaces of barley and rice leaves. Barley leaf images were captured at 200x magnification, while rice leaf images were taken at 400x. Stomata within these images were manually annotated using the LabelMe polygon tool, and the resulting JSON annotations were transformed into binary mask formats. These annotated images and corresponding masks served as training data for the YOLO object detection model.
