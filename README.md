#Stomata Detection#
A collection of 1000 microscopic images were collected from the abaxial leaves of rice and barley plants.
The leaves were captured at 200x in barley and 400x magnification in rice.
Stomata were manually segmented using a polygon and converted into binary mask.
The images and binary masks were used to train YOLO model.
