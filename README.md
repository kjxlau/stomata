### Stomata Detection
A collection of 1000 microscopic images were collected from the abaxial leaves of barley and rice plants.
The leaves were captured at 200x and 400x magnification in barley and rice respectively.
Stomata were manually segmented using a polygon tool and converted into binary masks.
The images and binary masks were used to train YOLO model.
